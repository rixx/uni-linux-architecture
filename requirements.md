# General

## "What do we expect?"

 - Analyze requirements management and architecture of a large real-world software project
 - Describe its development process and evolution
 - Use appropriate methods, techniques, and tools to analyze and document the architecture
 - A report that describes the process and the outcome of the requirements and architecture analysis

## Example Questions to be addressed

 - How are requirements managed? (Process, Tools)
 - Architecture
    - Is the architectural documentation available?
    - Which architectural styles are used?
    - Is it a product line architecture? (Variability)
    - Have quantitative techniques been used for the architecture evaluation/optimization?
    - How has the architecture evolved over the years?
    - Have researchers analyzed these projects already? Which techniques have been applied? Results?
