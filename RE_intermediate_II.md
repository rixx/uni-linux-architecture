## RE by external parties

## Community RE

 - no explicit RE
     - rejection of fixed interfaces
     - no plans for future releases
 - RE as a mix of community needs and Quality Control
     - community provides input and implementations (unstructured)
     - maintainers perform strict Quality Control
 - Quality Control as a workflow
     - very strict and hierarchical workflow
     - every step includes Quality Control
     - actual Quality Control is assured by taking personal responsibility
 - TODO: Implications and historical development
